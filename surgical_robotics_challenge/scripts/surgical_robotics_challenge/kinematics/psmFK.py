# THIS IS THE FK FOR THE PSM MOUNTED WITH THE LARGE NEEDLE DRIVER TOOL. THIS IS THE
# SAME KINEMATIC CONFIGURATION FOUND IN THE DVRK MANUAL. NOTE, JUST LIKE A FAULT IN THE
# MTM's DH PARAMETERS IN THE MANUAL, THERE IS A FAULT IN THE PSM's DH AS WELL. BASED ON
# THE FRAME ATTACHMENT IN THE DVRK MANUAL THE CORRECT DH CAN FOUND IN THIS FILE

# ALSO, NOTICE THAT AT HOME CONFIGURATION THE TIP OF THE PSM HAS THE FOLLOWING
# ROTATION OFFSET W.R.T THE BASE. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR IK PURPOSES.

#       = [ 1,  0,  0 ]
#       = [ 0,  0, -1 ]
# Basically, x_7 is along y_0, y_7 is along x_0 and z_7 is along -z_0.

# You need to provide a list of joint positions. If the list is less that the number of joint
# i.e. the robot has 6 joints, but only provide 3 joints. The FK till the 3+1 link will be provided
